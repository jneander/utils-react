### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- convert to typescript
- `babel` is no longer used in producing build output. Browser compatibility with this library is
  now the responsibility of the consumer.
- `useStore` and `useUid` are no longer available from this library. They have effectively been
  replaced by hooks available directly from React.
